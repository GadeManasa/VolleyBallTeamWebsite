            <img src="./Images/volleyball.jpg" class="teamImg" alt="vollyball team" />
            <p>Saint Louis University — located in St. Louis, Missouri, with a campus in Madrid, Spain, is one of the nation’s oldest and most prestigious Catholic universities. Founded in 1818, SLU is recognized for world-class academics, life-changing research, compassionate health care, and a strong commitment to faith and service.</p>
            <p>SLU's Jesuit tradition demands excellence in research and teaching, and our renowned faculty have embraced an
            unrelenting focus on academic quality. Jesuit schools are known for high academic standards, and we uphold
            this reputation with pride.
            We don't so much embrace ideas as challenge them, ensuring our students are better prepared to make a
            difference in an increasingly complex and demanding world.</p>

                <h1>50 years ago, scientists dug into Pangaea's past lives</h1>
                <img src="./Images/7.jpg" class="boxImg" />
                <p><b>Details: </b>The continents as we know them resulted when the proto­continent Pangaea broke apart
                    and its fragments made the long slow journey to their present positions. The process took about 200
                    m­illion years. But the Earth’s crust is an estimated 4.5 billion years old.… [Scientists are
                    exploring] the perplexing p­roblem of what went on during the billions of years before Pangaea went
                    to pieces.</p>

                <img src="./Images/8.jpg" class="boxImg" />
                <p><b>Details: </b>The European Space Agency (ESA) last week approved the $420 million Harmony mission
                    as the next in its Earth Explorer line of science missions, following a competition. Harmony’s two
                    satellites will carry infrared sensors and radar receivers to observe the turbulent waves, winds,
                    and eddies that govern the interchange of heat and gases between the oceans and atmosphere.</p>

                <h1>New tools for chemistry education and outreach for these</h1>
                <img src="./Images/5.jpg" class="boxImg" />
                <p><b>Details: </b>Over seven years ago I was listening to an episode of the fabulous science podcast
                    RadioLab that stopped me in my tracks. For RadioLab fans, this might not seem so surprising given
                    the show's knack for sharing science by combining storytelling with opulent sound design… but this
                    time it was different.</p>

                <h1>The credibility of science is damaged when universities brag about themselves</h1>
                <img src="./Images/6.jpg" class="boxImg" />
                <p><b>Details: </b>About 25 years ago, it was predicted that attention would come to dominate the
                    marketplace. The prediction was correct. Science is not immune to the "attention economy." In fact,
                    it plays an active role in it. However, the things that are seen as being of value to individual
                    scientists or institutions, like media attention, are undermining public trust and devaluing science
                    as a collective resource.</p>
