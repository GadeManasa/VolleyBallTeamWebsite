        <ul class="eventList">
            <li>Saint Louis continues Atlantic 10 Conference play with a pair of weekend matches against George Mason at Chaifetz Pavilion.</li>
            <li>First serve is slated for 7 p.m. on Friday and 2 p.m. on Saturday. Both contests will be streamed to ESPN+. </li>
            <li>Billiken themed volleyball cups will be given to the first 100 SLU students in attendance.</li>
            <li>The Billikens are 13-1 all-time against the Patriots and have never dropped a home contest to GMU.</li>
            <li>SLU is one of four A-10 teams that went 2-0 on opening weekend of conference play last week.</li>
            <li>With 142 on the year, SLU continues to lead the NCAA in service aces. Billikens occupy the top three spots in the A-10 in service aces, led by Carlie Rodgers and her NCAA fifth-ranked 33 aces. SLU and Coppin State (141) are the only two teams in the country that have more than 125 service aces. </li>
            <li> In addition to leading the A-10 in service aces, Rodgers is second in the league with 4.84 digs per set. Her 276 total digs are first in the conference and 21st nationally.</li>
            <li> Jillian Mattingly hit for a season-high .706 attack percentage in last Friday's win over Rhode Island. She leads the team and is second in the conference with .350 percentage on the season. Mattingly's .369 career hitting percentage ranks 13th among active players in the NCAA.</li>
            <li>Tickets can be purchased here or at the door, and parking is available in the Olive/Compton garage.</li>
            <li>Last season, Raising Canes teamed up with the SLU volleyball team to donate $25 to the Billiken Bounty for every ace recorded during home conferences matches. The Billikens tallied 46 aces last season for a total donation amount of $1,150. A check presentation will take place prior to Friday's match.</li>
