In 2017 and 2019 SLU Men's A team won nationals, and in 2018 took 3rd. We are always looking for fun individuals to support our winning tradition.

Beginning in October, we travel to several tournaments each semester and host the Billiken Bash right on SLU's campus. For several years SLU has spent the season in the top 25 ranking list published by NCVF, and has finished strong at Nationals. This year SLU is looking for some new talent. We also have the addition of a B team that is expected to be very competitive. This season SLU is expecting to be a dominating force in the Midwest and on the national level.</p>
